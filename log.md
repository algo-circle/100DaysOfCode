# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 26, 2020 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: 
-Solved questions on Strings.
-Learned how to sort a sentence based on word length in it.

**Thoughts:** The first day is supposed to be slow they say and so it was. I intend to pick up pace along the way and solve more complex problems.


### Day 1: March 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
-Solved more questions on strings.


### Day 2: March 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**:
-Solved some questions on Arrays.

**Thoughts:** Planned on doing all the sortings but couldn't allocate time today. Perhaps tomorrow.
Slow progress is still better than no progress.
