# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 26, 2020 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: 
-Solved questions on Strings.
-Learned how to sort a sentence based on word length in it.

**Thoughts:** The first day is supposed to be slow they say and so it was. I intend to pick up pace along the way and solve more complex problems.
